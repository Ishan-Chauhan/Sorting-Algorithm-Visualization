# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization
In these programs I have visualized different sorting algorithm such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort & merge sort with the help of turtle library. 
Turtle is a pre-installed library in python which provides us a virtual canvas, on which we can draw different shapes and figures.
